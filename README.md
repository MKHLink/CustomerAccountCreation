# CustomerAccountCreation
A program I worked on for my advanced Java class in Queens College

# Purpose and Specifications
Design a class named Person with fields for holding a person’s name, address, and telephone number. Write on
or more constructors and the appropriate mutator and accessor methods for the class’s fields.

Next, design a class named Customer, which extends the Person class. The Customer class should have a field
for a customer member number and a boolean field indicating whether the customer wishes to be on a mailing
list. Write one or more constructors and the appropriate mutator and accessor methods for the class’s fields.

A retail store has a preferred customer plan where customers can earn discounts on all their purchases. The
amount of a customer’s discount is determined by the amount of the customer’s cumulative purchases in the
store as follows:
• When a preferred customer spends $500, he or she gets a 5 percent discount on all future purchases.
• When a preferred customer spends $1000, he or she gets a 6 percent discount on all future purchases.
• When a preferred customer spends $1500, he or she gets a 7 percent discount on all future purchases.
• When a preferred customer spends $2000, he or she gets a 10 percent discount on all future purchases.

Design a class named PreferredCustomer, which extends the Customer class. The PreferredCustomer class
should have fields for the amount of the customer’s purchases and the customer’s discount level. Write on or
more constructors and the appropriate mutator and accessor methods for the class’s fields. Demonstrate the
PreferredCustomer class in a simple program.
